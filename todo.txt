Things to add:

1. Roles and permissions
2. Use session manager instead of accessing via SSH in a public IP, or at least limit the access to port 22 to specific IPs
3. Add tags to each resource, so that it's easier to manage them and track their cost
4. Use a separate security group for the EC2 machines (prevents access to port 80/8080) and the LB (prevents access to port 22).
    Make sure you approve access to port 8080 on the EC2 security group from the LB security group.
